# Chromia Staking Project

## Overview

### Project Description
This project implements a staking protocol using Chromia, Rell, and the FT4 library. Users can stake FT4 tokens to earn a 10% annual yield. The yield can be claimed at any time, and users can initiate an unstake request, which will allow them to withdraw their tokens after a two-week notice period. A simple frontend is provided for interacting with the staking protocol.

### How It Works
1. **Staking Tokens:** Users can stake their FT4 tokens via the web interface. Staked tokens generate a 10% annual yield.
2. **Accumulated Yield:** Users can query the current accumulated yield at any time through the interface.
3. **Claiming Yield:** Users can claim their accumulated yield at any time, which will be credited to their account.
4. **Unstaking Tokens:** Users can initiate an unstake request. After a two-week notice period, they can withdraw their staked tokens.
5. **Unstake Request Status:** Users can query the status of their unstake request at any time through the interface.
